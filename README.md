<h1>Landing Page</h1>

This is a landing page that showcases my skills in front-end web development. The website was built using only raw HTML and CSS, and it is fully responsive, supporting from ultra-wide monitors to small mobile screens.

<h3>Project Overview</h4>

The header includes a logo and a navigation menu with buttons that lead to different sections of the page, as well as a profile and cart button.

The main section has a big eye-catching banner, wich a call-to-action button. This section is supposed to include any content that should be highlighted in the page.

The products section has a scrollabe showcase of products, with images and descriptions about each.

The contact section gives the user a simple way to insert their email and get in touch.

The footer contains other low-profile relevant information, such as social media links and legal disclaimers.
